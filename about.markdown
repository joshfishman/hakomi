# About Hakomi House

Hakomi house of Ashland Oregon is preparing to reopen its stores for a new beginning in January 2025. 

After a long pause, we will once again offer an authentic in person experience of The Ron Kurtz Refined Hakomi method of mindfulness-based, body-centered, assisted self discovery. 

Having served as a place for Ron Kurtz to develop and teach his refined Hakomi Method from 1997 until his death in 2011, the Hakami House retreat-like gathering space and land are alive with the spirit of Hakomi and the memory of Ron Kurtz.

Whether you are seeking personal growth and healing, professional skills building or certification as a Hakomi practitioner, our five month, 15 day immersion training will meet each participant where they are at and attend to individual needs and goals.

Refined Hakomi defies definition as it is at the same time, scientific, psychotherapeutic and spiritual. 

Refined Hakomi is unrivaled as a pure, powerful and practical spiritual practice that transcends psychotherapy by reaching to the very depths of the subconscious/soul facilitating a truly life-changing transformational experience that is lasting and life-changing.

After meeting Ron Kurtz in 1997 I was blessed to train directly with him for many years. 

As a certified Hakomi therapist teacher and trainer, my role in the Refined Hakomi Special Training Group is that of a midwife in support of rebirthing our capacity to give and receive love. 

I hold all participants as equally precious, see each one as having their own unique needs and goals, meet every student where they are at and support them in an ongoing process of assisted self-discovery, spontaneous healing and expanding their capacity for relationship.
